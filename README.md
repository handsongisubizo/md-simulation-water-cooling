# Water Cluster Cooling Simulation using LAMMPS

This project shows molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water molecules in both 3D periodic systems using LAMMPS. As the system cools, water molecules transition from a dispersed state to condensed clusters, mimicking phenomena such as condensation and early-stage freezing.

>  This project is currently in progress. Simulation input files, scripts, and results will be uploaded soon.
